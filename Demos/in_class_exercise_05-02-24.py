Suppose
1% of people have cancer;
Out of the people who truly have cancer and get tested, 80% of these tests detect cancer correctly;
Out of the people who do not have cancer and get tested, 9.6% of these tests still return a cancer-positive results.

Question: If you get a positive result, what is the probability you actually have cancer?
'''

# What we want to know: P(cancer | positive) -- given a positive result, the probability of having cancer
# What you already know: P(cancer) -- the probability of a person has cancer
# What you learnt: P(positive|cancer) -- given someone has cancer, the probability they get a positive result
# What you also learnt: P(positive|no cancer) -- given someone does not have cancer, the probability they get a positive result

# Remember joint probability P(A and B) and marginal probability P(A)?
# If we add all the possible joint probability for event A,
# we are going to get the marginal probability for P(A)
# So you can either have cancer, or not have cancer.
# If we add these two outcomes together, we get the probability of having cancer
# So, P(positive) = P(positive and cancer) + P(positive and no cancer)

# Remember the definition of conditional probability? P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
# Accordingly, P(A and B) = P(A|B) * P(B)
