# This is a skeleton for your assignment 2 script.
# It contains the program structure, function names,
# the main function already written,
# and comment instructions regarding what you should write.

# SUMMARY OF WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
# You will only need to fill in several lines of code.
# The program looks long because of the comments; it is actually very short.
# Look for TODO items! (But read the comments, too :) ).


# Import the system module
import sys

# Import regular expressions module
import re

# Import the string module to access its punctuation set
import string

# The function below should be called on a file name.
# It should open the file, read its contents, and store it in a variable.
# Then it should remove punctuation marks and return the "cleaned" text.

def cleanFileContents(f):
    # The two lines below open the file and read all the text from it
    # storing it into a variable called "text".
    # You do not need to modify the below two lines; they are already working as needed.
    with open(f, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        text = f.read()

    # The line below will clean the text of punctuation marks.
    # Ask if you are curious about how it works! But you can just use it as is.
    # Observe the effect of the function by inspecting the debugger pane while stepping over.
    clean_text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))

    # Now, we will want to replace all tabs with spaces, and also all occurrences of more than one
    # space in a row with a single space. Review the regular expression slides/readings, and
    # write a statement below which replaces all occurrences of one or more whitespace-group characters
    # (that will include tabs) with a single space. You want the re.sub function.
    # The shortcut for all whitespace characters is \s. The regex operator for "one or more" is +.
    # Read re.sub()'s documentation to understand which argument goes where in the parentheses.

    # TODO: Modify the next line ``clean_text = clean_text`` into
    # a line that calls a re.sub function of the regular expression module
    # to replace all more than one space into single space
    # and save the results to the variable clean_text.
    clean_text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', clean_text)

    # Do not forget to return the result!
    return clean_text


'''
The below function takes a string as input, breaks it down into word tokens by space, and stores, in a dictionary table,
how many times each word occurred in the text. It returns the dictionary table.
'''


def countTokens(text):
    # Initializing an empty dictionary. Do not modify the line below, it is already doing what is needed.
    token_counts = {}

    # Use the split() function, defined for strings, to split the text by space.
    # Store the result in a variable, e.g. called "tokens".
    # See what the split() function returns and stores in your variable
    # as you step through the execution in the debugger.

    # TODO: Write a statement below calling split() on your text
    #  and storing the result in a new variable.
    tokens = text.split()

    # Now, the task is to create a dictionary,
    # where each unique word that occurs in the text has a key in the dictionary.
    # The value of the key is the number of occurrence of that work in the text.
    # For example, if the word "movie" occurs twice in the text,
    # there should be an element of "movie":2 in the dictionary.
    # To achieve this goal, we need to iterate over each word in the list of tokens
    # (write a for loop over the list that split() returned).
    # Inside the loop, that is, for each word, we will perform some conditional logic:
    #   If the word is not yet stored in the dictionary
    #   we called "token_counts" as a key, we will store it there now,
    #   and we will initialize the key's value to 0.
    # Outside that if statement: now that we are sure
    # the word is stored as a key, we will increment the count by 1.

    # TODO: Write a for loop here, doing what is described above.
    for token in tokens:
        if token not in token_counts:
            token_counts[token] = 0
        token_counts[token] += 1

    # Do not forget to return the result!
    return token_counts


# This silly "prediction function" will do the following "rudimentary data science":
# If a review contains more of the word "good" than of the word "bad",
# the function predicts "positive" (by returning a string "POSITIVE").
# If it contains more of the word "bad" than of the word "good",
# the function predicts "negative".
# If the count is equal (note that this includes zero count),
# the function cannot make a prediction and returns a string "NONE".


# Constants. Constants are important to avoid typo-related bugs, among other reasons.
# Use these constants as return values for the below function.

NONE = "NONE"

    # Do not forget to return the prediction! You will be returning one of the constants declared above.
    # You may choose to store a prediction in a variable and then write the return statement outside
    # of the if-else block, or you can have three return statements within the if-else block.

# The main function is the entry point of the program.
# When debugging, if you want to start from the very beginning,
# start here. NB: Put the breakpoint not on the "def" line but below it.

# You need to modify the functions which it calls, not the main() itself.

    filename = argv[1]  # Place the first breakpoint here, when starting.

    # Now, we will call a function called cleanFileContents on the filename we were passed.
    # NB: We could have called the function directly on argv[1]; that would have the same effect.

    # Now, we will count how many times each word occurs in the review.

    # Finally, let's print out what we predicted. Note how we are calling the format()
    # function on the string we are printing out, and we are passing it two
    # arguments: the file name and our prediction. This is a convenient way of
    # printing out results. We will keep using it in the future.
