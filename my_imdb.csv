0_9.txt,pos,train,Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as Teachers My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell Highs satire is much closer to reality than is Teachers The scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools I knew and their students When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school I immediately recalled at High A classic line INSPECTOR Im here to sack one of your teachers STUDENT Welcome to Bromwell High I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched What a pity that it isnt
0_3.txt,neg,train,Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig Starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of its singers Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting Even those from the era should be turned off The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader On a technical level its better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly
0_10.txt,pos,test,I went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine Ill admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher he was only able to do comedy I was wrong Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions This one did exactly that The entire theater which was sold out was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying This movie was great and I suggest that you go see it before you judge
0_2.txt,neg,test,Once again Mr Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters Most of us have ghosts in the closet and Costners character are realized early on and then forgotten until much later by which time I did not care The character we should really care about is a very cocky overconfident Ashton Kutcher The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks hes better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker Costner tells us all about Kutchers ghosts We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing No magic here it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in
